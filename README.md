# Sub-Store-Manager-Cli

English | [简体中文](./README-CN.md)

A CLI tool for managing [Sub-Store](https://github.com/sub-store-org/Sub-Store) backend service. Because of this tool based on [docker](https://www.docker.com/), you should install docker first.


# Install

You can install this tool by running the following command:

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nfervor/Sub-Store-Manager-Cli/master/.github/install.sh | bash
```

Or you can download [release binary](https://github.com/DesnLee/Sub-Store-Manager-Cli/releases) and configure your environment variable manually.


# Usage

If you are using a script installation, you can directly execute the following commands. However, if you are doing a manual installation, please make sure to modify the program name in each command to match the executable file name.


### new

Create a new sub-store docker container and run it. If the Image does not exist, it will be build automatically.

```bash
ssm new
```

this command support the following flags:

- `--interface` or `-i` : When you use the `-i` flag, a sub-store front-end container is created instead of a backend container. The default behavior is to create a backend container.

- `--name` or `-n` : A unique name for the container, default name is `ssm-backend`, If you create a frontend container with the `-i` flag, the default name will be `ssm-frontend`. This name will be used to manage persistent data. As long as the persistent data with this name is not manually deleted, or execute `ssm delete` with `-c` flag, it will be accessible whenever the container is rebuilt or when the image is deleted and then launched using this name.

- `--version` or `-v` : A [Sub-Store release](https://github.com/sub-store-org/Sub-Store/releases) version string, default is latest. If you pass `-i` to create a front-end container, `-v` will be ignored, it always uses the latest version of the front-end.

- `--port` or `-p` : To successfully create a new Docker container, you need to specify the port mapping. The default port is `3000`, and it must be available. If you pass `-i` to create a front-end container, the default port will be `80`. If you want to access the container using a domain name, you will need to manually proxy this port with a reverse proxy tool such as Nginx or Caddy.

- `--network` : Specify a docker network, which has the same effect as `--network` in `docker run`. If not specified, use Host mode. If specified, use Bridge mode. If the network exists, join it; if not, create it and then join.

- `--private` : Switch the HostIP of the container to `127.0.0.1`, if not specified, use the default `0.0.0.0`.

### update

To update a sub-store docker container, ensure that the image already exists and is running.

```bash
ssm update
```

this command support the following flags:

- `--name` or `-n` : A name of running container, default name is `ssm-backend`.

- `--version` or `-v` : A [Sub-Store release](https://github.com/sub-store-org/Sub-Store/releases) version string, default is latest. If you update a front-end container, `-v` will be ignored, it always uses the latest version of the front-end.


### start

Start a non-running sub-store Docker container by name, default name set as `ssm-backend`.

> Equivalent to `docker start <name>`.

```bash
ssm new <name>
```


### stop

Stop a running sub-store Docker container by name, default name set as `ssm-backend`.

> Equivalent to `docker stop <name>`.

```bash
ssm stop <name>
```


### delete

Delete a sub-store Docker container by name, default name set as `ssm-backend`.

> Equivalent to `docker rm -f <name>`.

```bash
ssm delete <name>
```

this command support the following flags:

- `--clear` or `-c` : Delete the persistent data of the container at the same time. If you delete a front-end container, `-c` will be ignored, because the front-end container does not have persistent data.


### list

List all sub-store Docker containers.

> Equivalent to `docker ps -a`, filter which container started by `ssm` image.

```bash
ssm ls
```


### version

Print the version number of ssm.

```bash
ssm version
```


# Uninstall

If you are using a script installation, you can directly execute the following command. If you are doing a manual installation, please manually remove your executable file.

```bash
rm -rf /usr/local/bin/ssm
```

If you want to delete the persistent data of the container at the same time, you can execute the following command:

```bash
rm -rf ~/.ssm
```
